## Vision Transformer (ViT)

Our project leverages the Vision Transformer architecture, a revolutionary approach to computer vision that replaces traditional convolutional layers with self-attention mechanisms. ViT has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various image classification tasks, making it a powerful choice for image analysis.

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

In conjunction with ViT, we have implemented a CNN to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the model. This combination results in a robust and versatile neural network that excels in understanding complex visual patterns.

## Polygon Referral System

Introducing a Polygon Referral System that allows enhancing customer experience.

## Next.js Framework Implementation

The frontend of our application is built using the Next.js framework, offering a React-based, server-rendered web application with improved performance and SEO benefits. Next.js simplifies the development process and provides a smooth user experience.
